    <h1>Different Choropleth</h1>

    <h4>This choropleth is based around high school graduation per student in each county of Washington state. The target age range for this
        map is 18 - 24 years of age. 
        <br>Moreover, this map does not include  High School Equivalency options. I used Equivalent Intervals for this map in order to keep a consisten range between percents.

    <h4>This choropleth is based around high school graduation per student in each county of Washington state. The target age
        range for this
range for this
map is 25 - 38 years of age.
<br>This map does include High School Equivalency options like the GED. It is evident that the population pool was
vastly different from the previous chlorpleth because of the drastic change in graduation rates. One clear indicator is the expanded age pool in this case
<br>As such comparing choropleth to the previous one would not be very accurate.

<br>The age range in this chlorpleth and the previous one has a sligh overlap. However, it is not extremly signifcant. Moroever, the consisten age gap in this group allows for comparison between the previous one.
