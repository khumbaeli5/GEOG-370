    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>You can write a paragraph here</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is made in a way to maintain the area between the map. As such there is minimal stretch
        until the further one goes away from the equator. <br> In which case the land masses seem to be compressed.
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is made around a stretched ellipsoid. Therfore allowing for the area and proportion
        of the land to be displayed correctly,<br> while only having mild distortions around the edges
    of the elliposid </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The projection of the Pseudomercator is desgined around a cylinder wrapping around the globe.
        This cylindracl property allows for proportionate sizes around <br>the equator, while becoming larger the farther 
    away one strays from the equator. </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>The shape spherical liked shape of this projection allows for their to be as little distortion around the entire map. 
        Therefore allowing for a realitvely clear<br> observation of all the land areas.
    </h3>

    <h2>Cylndrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This projection allows for the area in between the boxes created by the circles to be preserved.
        As such allowing for a clear interpretation of the geography along <br>the equator, while distorting the shape
        of the land further North or South.

    <h2>Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection resembles what would happen if a cone would be wrapped around the Earth.
        As such it allows for a relatively<br> proportiante view of land masses streting around the North Pole
        , while causing distortions the further south one moves
    </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This projection is extremly similar to the Equidsitant conic approach as it focuses one centeral point.
        However, the main difference comes from having all points<br> be distanced around that central point, recreating a 
        sort of symetry

    </a>

    <h2>Sinusoidal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This Sinousiodal projection is projected in such a way to maintain the area and proportion of Africa
        to the greates extent. However this causes most other areas to<br> become extremly distorted. Especially the ones at 
        southern and northern tip since this projection seems to pinch and stretch the top and bottom of the map.

    <h2>Eckert-I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has an extremly intersting shape, as it is projected in a shape resembling a stretched out hexagon.
        Causing distortion when moving towards the edges,<br> but it allows the conservation of area in both eastern Europe and Africa.
