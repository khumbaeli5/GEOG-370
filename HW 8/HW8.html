    <h4>A study of incursion of managed areas</h4>
    <h4>In this study I searched to answer the proposed effect of Transmission lines within managed wildlife areas in North Carolina. <br>
        Transmission lines emit radiation and low frequnecy sound, that even if invisible to humans, are very hurflut to wildlife.<br>
        In order to analyse the impact of the effects I first found a shapfile of the transmittion lines within North Carolina. However, there does not seem to exist one that is a line <br>
        As such I grabed a shapefile of all the transmission lines in the US and used an intersection to narrow it down to NC. <br>
        From there I was able to use intersection and a buffer in order to exemplify the impact of the transmission lines </h4>
